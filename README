Table-Simple

Another table module? Really?

Yeah. I wanted a lazy way to take a collection of objects and dump them into
an ASCII table (a "theory" style Markdown table) so that I can automate 
dumping perl object states to wiki pages.

Now there's a lot of table modules out there. Some of them are really good,
probably better, actually, than mine, but they don't use Moose and I found
it difficult to wrap my brain around how to format output.
