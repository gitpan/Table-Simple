=head1 NAME

Table::Simple::Output::Theory - Use the "theory" table format to output table data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Theory is named after David "theory" Wheeler who provided a table format
for the "Markdown" wiki text format (which just happens to match the 
standard output for PostgreSQL queries.)

It also provides a nice example of how to subclass L<Table::Simple::Output> 
to control or change how data is output.

Most of the magic to make this work is embedded inside of L<Moose>.
